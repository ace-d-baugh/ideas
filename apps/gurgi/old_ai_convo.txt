You are my Idea-to-Reality Strategist—a forward-thinking partner who helps me shape and realize my ideas, whether they're physical products, digital tools, visual designs, or conceptual projects.

Sometimes I’ll have a clear vision of the end goal and just need help with the next steps, clarifying the in-between, or fleshing out details. Other times, I’ll need help exploring what the final concept could become. Your job is to be one, two, or several steps ahead—paving the way and helping me connect the dots between inspiration and execution.

You will:

Anticipate obstacles and suggest practical next actions.

Ask smart, probing questions to help me go deeper into the why, how, and for whom this idea exists.

Challenge assumptions respectfully, offering alternative perspectives that consider usability, market fit, and design intent.

Guide execution with tools, processes, and examples—focusing on practical, achievable progress, not just abstract thinking.

Maintain a balance between bold creativity and real-world implementation.


Treat each idea I share as a rough draft. Whether I need a spark, a plan, or refinement, help me bring it into focus and move it forward.

# 💡 Project Snapshot

**📁 Project Name:**  
G.U.R.G.I.

**🎯 End Goal:**  
This is an app that can be used in any browser to help train Disney or any theme park employee to know the best way to group guests onto ride vehicles quickly and efficiently.

**🔍 Current Focus:**  
Going over all aspects of the web app to make sure an AI vibe coding assistant understands the prompt given to it to generate the necessary code to create the full App. 

**🔧 What I Need Help With:**  
Coming up with a vibe coding script that will allow AI to build out the web application in one pass, or a series of scripts that will build on each other to vibe code the entire project. 

**❓ Questions or Unknowns:**  
Web stack, how to add it to my vps at gurgi.digitalelecance.com, seeing up the MongoDB, customizations, colors, UI, feasibility. 

**📌 Notes or Inspirations:**  
_Links, images, themes, references, etc._

### A. Web App

**🧠 User Stories:**  
As an admin of the app, I need a way to create rides to have for trainers to choose from. 

As a trainer at Disney, I need a way to train new cast members to group guests safely, quickly, and efficiently on to a ride in a fun and easy way. 

As a trainer, I need a way to choose the ride or type of ride system I want to train the cast member on. 

As a trainer, I need a way to customize the ride vehicle for my specific ride if it's not preloaded. 

As a trainer, I need a way to adjust the amount of guests that appear to my trainee. 

As a trainer, I need a way to add and adjust a timer or choose not to add one to the game of grouping. 

As a trainer, I need a way to adjust the min and max of guests per group. 

As a new cast member, I need a fun way to learn how to group guests in a safe way before grouping real guests. 

As a new cast member, I need to feel a sense of accomplishment in grouping guests in vehicles, but also feel challenged to do better as training goes on. 

As a new cast member, I need a way to tap on the first person in the group to expose the number in their group.

**Database design:**

Rides Interface
ID = num
Name = string
NameSlug = string
Location = ID
Ride Type = string enum
Guests array = array (array of array of numbers*) 
*2 dimensional array. Number of loads comes from number of arrays holding arrays. The number of guests per row are held in those arrays, number of rows comes from the array length. Typically this will be one array of an array of numbers. Only multiple intervals will have multiple arrays.*
Even/Odd lines = bool
Single riders = bool
Row request = bool
Double Groupable = bool
Active = bool

Location Interface
ID = Number
Name = String

**🗺️ Simple UX Flow:**  

Admin:
As the admin, I will be able to log in to the gurgi.digitalelegance.com/proprietor page that has a simple login form. A “forgot password” link under the password field.
Username: hornedking 
Password: Munch13s&Crunch13s 
Forgot password page asks for username. And then emails the password to ace@digitalelegance.com. If log in is successful, it takes the admin to the CRUD page: 2 scrollable tables, up to 15 rows for view at a time. 
Rides Table: Headings: Name, Location, blank (giving room for the edit and delete icons). The table of all rides in alphabetical order by name but can be reverse alphabetical order as well. The same sort applies to the location column and a filter is also available. A pencil icon to go to the edit page for the ride, or a trash can to ask if you wish to delete the ride. If you choose yes on the pop-up warning, then it will turn the active to false. An “Add Ride” button in the top right corner above the table.
Locations Table: A table of all the locations in order of creation, but sortable by name in alphabetical order or reverse order. In the row are the same pencil and trash can icons for edit and delete.

Trainer:
As the trainer, I enter in the url or follow a link given to me and come to the main page. (gurgi.digitalelegance.com takes you to the main page. gurgi.digitalelegance.com/magic-kingdom/barnstormer/ takes you to the individual game) The main page has the title “G.U.R.G.I. Guest Unit Ride Grouper Interface” and the icons of the four parks and a dropdown of all the rides populated by the database. If I tap on a park, the list of rides in the drop down is filtered to only that park. Once I select a ride, I am able to tap the GO button below the drop down list. Once selected, I am taken to the main game. I am greeted with a pop up of game options to choose. At the bottom of the game options pop up, there is a button that says “play”. When the settings are locked in and the play button is tapped, the game can begin. The timer is at the top in the middle. The timer, if activated, starts to count down the moment the trainee taps the first guest in line. I then hand the tablet or keyboard and mouse to the trainee.

Trainee:
As the Trainee, I simply play the game until the trainer takes over or I finish the round of however many vehicles I need to load. I tap on the first person in a group to see how many guests are in the group. I select the amount of guests I want to place in a row, and then I tap the row I want to place them in. I then go to the next group. If I need a single rider, I grab one of those from the single rider line, if applicable, and add them to the row I want. 

Game Play:
The object is to fill the entire ride's rows full of guests before the interval timer runs out (if there is one). Trainee taps on the first avatar in the line. This places a white outline around the first guest avatar of the guests in the group and the entire group turns from gray to one of six colors (blue, red, green, yellow, orange, and purple). The trainee then selects by tapping on individual avatars the amount of guests to place in a row. Each tap adds a selection white outline around the avatar. To place guests in the row, the trainee must have guests selected and then they tap on the row they wish to place the guests. If too many guests are selected for the row chosen, the outline flashes red and they shake slightly to show the trainee has chosen too many and they won't move. If there is enough or less to fill the row, the guests then walk to the row. If the trainee taps on the first guest avatar in line after the group, the white selection outline goes away from the other group avatar(s) and each guest in the next group goes from gray to colored. The trainee may select from either group, but only select guests from one group at a time. If the trainee taps on a guest from another group, all selected guests will lose their white selection outline. The trainee may choose to add avatars from another group to a row that is not currently full but may not exceed the amount of people allowed in the row. When the timer runs out the line(s) empty or the guests get on the ride vehicle. The same happens when the rows are to the point the trainee feels is full or full enough and hits the “Send It!” button where the interval timer normally is.
