## Questions for Ace

1. **GURGI** - Should I start building the database structure first, or focus on the game interface?
2. **D'VINS** - Do you want to start with the React Native app or the backend API first?
3. **Sonic Smarties** - Do you have 3D printing capabilities, or should I research manufacturing options?
