## Questions for Ace

1. **GURGI** - What does "GURGI" stand for? The database design is very detailed but I'm not sure what the app does.
2. **D'VINS** - Is this a wine tasting app, inventory management, or something else? The BRD is comprehensive but I want to understand the core concept.
3. **Sonic Smarties** - What kind of product is this? The PRD is basic but I'm curious about the concept.
4. **Art Techo Designer** - Is this for digital art creation or technical design work?
