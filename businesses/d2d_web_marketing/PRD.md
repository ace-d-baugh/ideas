# D2D Web Marketing

## Summary
A business opportunity for a web marketer to initiate a conversation with a small business and offer them the web presense they need at a fraction of the price as bigger web marketing businesses do who offen overlook small businesses. By contacting the owner of the small business and asking a few questions about the business, the marketer would be able to provide a quick mock-up of a new, up-to-date website and marketing materials. For example: The marketer walks up to a local massage parlor. They may have a website, but it is old and doesn't have correct information anymore. Once in front of the owner, the marketer will ask about their current situation and see where they can improve. They will discuss the goals and branding and then, using AI, will provide a updated option for them right then and there without having to leave and come back. Options for improvement may be a new website, a new logo and branding, email marketing, social media presense, etc.
