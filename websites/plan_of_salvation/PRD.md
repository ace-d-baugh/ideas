# Plan of Salvation

## Summary
Interactive side-scrolling website that is a version of the fourth missionary discussion graphic that teachess The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints' view of the pre-mortal, mortal, and post-mortal existances. There would be a semi-3D created character that moves throughout the screen that goes to each point of the plan. Each point will have a little dialog box filled with what each point is and the corresponding scriptures. As you scroll the person advances through the plan in either direction.
