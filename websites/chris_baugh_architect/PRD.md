# Chris Baugh Architect

## Summary
A new version of Chris Baugh Archetich website that is more modern. Scrolling effects that start with a hero section of a napkin drawing of a house, then wipes to the blueprints, then to a CAD version, then to the wooden beams structure, then to finally a photo of the finished house.
