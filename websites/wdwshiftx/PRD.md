## 3. Verification & Security

### The Registration Handshake

1. **Input:** User provides Email, Password, HubID, PERNER.
2. **Server-Side Validation:**
   - HubID Regex: `/^[a-zA-Z]{5}\d{3}$/` (e.g., HAUGM027)
   - PERNER Regex: `/^\d{8}$/` (e.g., 01713069)
   - Email not on "Balck List"
3. **Action:** If validation passes, account is created with `email_verified = false`.
4. **Email Verification:** Verification link sent to provided email. Account remains inactive until verified.
5. **Disposal:** HubID and PERNER are used only for initial validation and are never stored in the database.
6. **Terms & Conditions:** Checkbox required to enable registration submit button. T&C link opens in new tab.

### Email Changes

- Users can update email addresses.
- New email must be verified before old email is replaced.
- Re-login required after email change.
- **Auto-Promotion:** If new email is @disney.com, user is promoted to CoPro upon next login.
- **Auto-Demotion:** If CoPro or Leader changes from @disney.com to non-Disney email, user is demoted to Cast. Warning displayed before change.

### Inactivity Management

- **3-Month Email:** "Hey ya, Pal. We miss you around here. Hope all is well. Login to stay active or if you would like, your account will be deactivated in 60 days of inactivity."
- **5-Month Purge:** Account deactivated (`is_active = false`). All associated posts become orphaned but remain visible with original created_by name.

---

## 4. The Proficiency Database

Three-tier system to ensure users only see shifts they are qualified for:

- **Property:** High-level entity (e.g., Magic Kingdom, EPCOT, Animal Kingdom, Resorts). Admin-managed only.
- **Location:** Specific area within a property (e.g., Casey's Corner, Jungle Cruise, Front Desk).
- **Role:** Job function (e.g., Quick Service F&B, Attractions, Custodial, Concierge).

### User Proficiency Suggestions

- Cast can suggest new Locations and Roles.
- Suggestions are immediately added to suggester's profile and available for use by others.
- Suggestions remain in pending approval queue until reviewed by Leaders.
- Leaders access pending items via dedicated queue page with login notification badge.
- **Rejected suggestions:** Deleted system-wide.
- Queue sorted by submission timestamp.

---

## 5. Feature Requirements

### A. The Shift Board (Offers)

**Dynamic Filtering:**
- Automatically filters shifts based on user's saved proficiencies.

**Sorting:**
1. `start_time` (Ascending)
2. `created_at` (Descending)

**Expiration Engine:**
- Automated process (cron job) marks shifts as inactive (`is_active = false`) exactly 30 minutes before `start_time`.

**Display Badges:**
- **Trade:** Clear visual indicator (pill/tag)
- **Giveaway:** Clear visual indicator (pill/tag)
- **Overtime Approved:** Badge with legal disclaimer in T&C: "Verify OT approval before claiming"
- Posts can have multiple badges (e.g., Trade + Giveaway + OT)

**Post Editing:**
- Users can edit their own posts as long as `is_active = true`.
- No notifications sent for edits.
- Edit history visible to CoPros+ for abuse tracking.

**Post Deactivation:**

### E. Moderation & Flagging

**Flag Targets:**
- Posts (offers and requests)

**Flag Triggers:**
- Fake posts
- Inappropriate comments/wording
- Posting for someone else without permission
- Other misconduct

**Flag Workflow:**
1. Cast/CoPro/Leader clicks flag button on post or profile.
2. Flag enters pending queue with status `pending`.
3. Flagged content remains visible.
4. Leaders see flags filtered by their proficiencies only.
5. Leaders can:
   - **Resolve:** Mark flag as resolved with action taken.
   - **Dismiss:** Mark flag as dismissed.
6. Flagged users are not notified until action is taken.

**Documentation:**
- Flags serve as audit trail for potential fireable offenses.
- Leaders can view target's Property/Location/Role via `target_id`.

**Deactivation:**
- CoPros can deactivate other CoPros.
- Leaders can deactivate CoPros and other Leaders.
- Leaders can demote themselves and others.
- Deactivated users: all associated posts become orphaned but remain visible with original created_by name.

---

### F. Archive & History

**Access:**
- Leaders and Admins only.

**Contents:**
- Posts no older than 90 days (both offers and requests).
- Deactivated posts (user-deleted).

**Search & Filter:**
- Same filters as live boards (Property, Location, Role, Date range) adding keyword search.

**Display:**
- Separate section/page from live boards.
- Orphaned posts show original username (e.g., "Matthew B.").

---

### G. Security
**Failed Registration Flow:**
 - HubID & PERNER must pass Regex upon atempting to submit registration
 - Registration page reloads with everything filled out but empty inputs for HubID and PERNER warning: "HubID or PERNER or both are not correct, please enter them again or see you Leader for correct formatting."
 - Five failed attempts will place the email address in the banned emails list

**Email Black List**
 - Blocked emails from creating or recreating profiles.

---
## 6. Technical Considerations

### Infrastructure

**"Saturday Night Spike":**
- Anticipated high traffic Saturday nights (23:30–02:00 ET).
- Serverless functions (Vercel/Supabase) for elastic scaling.

**Database Indexing:**
- `shifts`: (`is_active`, `start_time`, `created_at`)
- `requests`: (`is_active`, `requested_date`, `preferred_times`)
- `flags`: (`status`, `created_at`)
- `users`: (`email`), (`role`, `is_active`)
- `user_proficiencies`: (`user_id`, `location_id`, `role_id`)
- `black_list_emails`: (`email`)

### Rate Limiting (API)

- `POST /shifts`: 28 per 24hrs per user
- `POST /proficiency-suggestion`: 10 per 24hrs per user
- `POST /flag`: 20 per 24hrs per user
- General API: 1000 requests per 15min per IP
- Login attempts: 5 per 15min per email

### Security

- Soft deletes (`is_active = false`) for auditability.
- All passwords hashed (bcrypt/Argon2).
- Email verification required for all users.
- HTTPS only.

---

## 7. Accessibility & Mobile Requirements

### Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance)

- **Color Contrast:** Minimum 7:1 ratio.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** All modals, forms, and interactive elements.
- **Screen Reader Testing:** Nice-to-have if resources allow.
- **Touch Targets:** Minimum 44x44px for mobile.

### Mobile-First Design

- **Responsive:** Optimized for phones, tablets, desktops.
- **No Offline Mode:** Requires live connection for up-to-date data.
- **PWA:** Installable on iOS, Android, desktop (PC/Mac/Linux).

---

## 8. Notification System (Future Enhancement)

**Delivery Methods:**
- Email
- SMS
- Both
- None (user preference)

**Triggers:**
- New shift/request matching user proficiencies (instant alerts).
- Proficiency-agnostic (user chooses notification preferences globally).

**Implementation:**
- Paid service tier (TBD).
- Requires phone number capture during registration.
